# Tableau
Contains a couple work-in-progress Tableau Dashboards 

Provided are screenshots of two dashboards that I am in progress of completing as practice working in Tableau. The Spotify dashboard shows information about the top artists and songs of 2023, measured by total streams. The data warehouse (DW) dashboard shows an analysis of the business's profits by geography and product category.
